                    There have been plenty of viral attacks in the past that took the lives of millions of people!<br>
                    Smallpox and measles viruses are among the oldest that infect humans. Having evolved from viruses that infected other animals, they first appeared in humans in Europe and North Africa thousands of years ago. <br><br>
                    The viruses were later carried to the New World by Europeans during the time of the Spanish Conquests, but the indigenous people had no natural resistance to the viruses and millions of them died during epidemics.<br><br>
                    Influenza pandemics have been recorded since 1580, and they have occurred with increasing frequency in subsequent centuries.
                     The pandemic of 1918–1919, in which 40–50 million died in less than a year, was one of the most devastating in history.
                     <br>So it is true that viruses are some dangerous little guys! <br><br>
                    Lets look at a table to get an idea about the greatest pandemics in human history;<p>
