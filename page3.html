                            <p style = "font-family:optima" >Covid has so far spread across 160 countries and affected almost 5,418,237 people.<br> The sad part is almost 350,000 people have so far died due to this pandemic.<br> Also 2,254,334 people have so far recovered.<br>
                               Another alarming fact is that the vaccine for this new strain of virus has not yet been found. <br><br>So what can we do at this situation? Before we move into that let us try to understand what a Coronavirus is.<br>
                               Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that are common among animals.<br> In rare cases, we scientists call them zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br>
                               The viruses can make people sick, usually with a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness, similar to a common cold.<br> Coronavirus symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, possibly a headache and maybe a fever, which can last for a couple of days.<br>
For those with a weakened immune system, the elderly and the very young, there's a chance the virus could cause a lower, and much more serious, respiratory tract illness like a pneumonia or bronchitis.
